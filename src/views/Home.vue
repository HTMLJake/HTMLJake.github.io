          You are probably looking at this site for one of a few reasons. Either
          you are trying to see if I am someone you think is worth hiring, or
          its my mom checking out my site to see how it looks. Either way I make
          to make a good impression and hope that you like the way things look,
          or at least maybe you will chuckle. Like when you watch those videos
          of a cat playing the piano, its just so adorable üòç. Wait, getting off
          topic...
          <em>Alright jacob we gotta look professional, pull it together!</em>
          Anyways, I look forward to hearing what you think. But really though,
          you should go check out those cat videos. 10/10, would watch again.
          You know what, here is a gif of it, just for you.
