          So you are probably looking at this site for one of two reasons. Either you are trying to see if I am someone you think is worth hiring, or... It's my mom checking out my site to see how it looks. If it's the latter, Hi Mom! But if not, well then I hope this site will help you figure out if I am someone you would want working for you! And at least maybe you will chuckle. Like when you watch those videos of a cat playing the piano... its just so adorable üòç. Wait, getting off topic... <em>Alright Jacob, we have to look professional, pull it together!</em> In any case, thank you for taking the time to check out my site. Enjoy your stay here and please keep all hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times!

          ...But really though, you should go check out those cat videos. 10/10, would watch again.

          You know what, here is a gif of it, just for you. üòâ
