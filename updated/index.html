                    Hello, I am Jacob Perry, and I'm a bit of a Jacob… I mean Jack of all Trades. I reside in the beautiful northwest in Everett, WA, just north of Seattle. I have a passion for a lot of things because I love to learn new things and challenge myself to always be better. I want to be a modern Rennessance? nope … rennisounce? Not quite... *opens google…* so close… Renaissance man. What I lack in years of experience I make up for in creatively thinking about the box (or was it thinking outside the regular hexahedron *closes google*) Either way I like to make stuff, learn things, and speak vague. Some of the hats that I wear are Frontend Developer, Game Developer, Graphic Designer, Musician, and Photographer.

                    Programming was something that I was always interested in but never really thought to seriously about as a child. I thought that is was something that people much smarter than me would do and I would just work on doing art. But as it turns out I wasn’t all that great at art either so I started to think more seriously about programming. So in high school I took an intro to web design class and learned the basics of HTML and CSS and was pretty happy with the results but as I tried to learn more about web programming I just overwhelmed with all the buzzwords and frameworks and tools that I just didn’t know where to start. It wasn’t till I had decided to learn how to program in C# making games that I thought I would give web design another shot, but this time I chose to take an online classes. It was in these online classes that I started to learn to enjoy web programming as much as I had learned to love making games. I finally understood what it took to make a website that worked and looked good and was more than just some HTML and CSS.

                        	I am going to come right out and say it. I am not good at art. At least not with a pencil and paper. But graphic design isn't just being able to draw, its being able to create, and that is something that I can do. I enjoy simplicity and it shows in a lot of my designs. I like to try and keep details clean and minimalistic. I find that I enjoy working with typography and logo design a lot. I may not be able to create a vector lion with thousands of Bezier curves and lines, but I can creatively use text and simple shapes to create abstract logos and designs. I also find pride in being self-taught and always finding new ways to improve my design and make them even better and more interesting than the last.
